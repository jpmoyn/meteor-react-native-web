# meteor-react-native-web
A simple client only boilerplate app for the react-native-web package used within the Meteor.js framework

This gives you the ability to use Native UI components from the React Native project on the web with a meteor application.

This simple boilerplate will save you about an hour setting up all of the necessary components :)

To get started, clone the repo, and then install the necessary npm packages like so:

`meteor npm install --save react react-dom react-native-web`


For documentation regarding the react-native-web package see the repo: https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web

For documentation on the React Native components check out the official docs: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html
